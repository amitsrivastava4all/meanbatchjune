/*
 1. JavaScript is good at handling strings, but because it was initially designed to manipulate
 HTML documents, it is not very good at handling binary data. JavaScript doesn’t have a byte
 type — it just has numbers — or structured types, or even byte arrays: It just has strings.
 Because Node is based on JavaScript, Node can handle text protocols like HTTP, but you can
 also use it to talk to databases, manipulate images, and handle file uploads

 2. The Buffer class is a global, making it very rare that one would need to ever require('buffer').
